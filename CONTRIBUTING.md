# Contributing to OpenSCD Core
Thanks for showing interest in contributing to the OpenSCD Core project ü§ù 

## Code Style
Here are some important code style resources:

* We try to follow [Deno's Style Guide](https://deno.land/manual/contributing/style_guide) for our Typescript files, although there are cases where it will make sense to break the rules (as in life).
* Our commit messages are written in accordance with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Commits also must tackle one topic at a time. If your commit message consits on a list of affairs addressed there, this can be hint that you need to create sepparate commits for each affair instead.

## Linting & Formatting

If you use VSCode to develop, we recommend you install and use the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions in order to automatically lint and format your code as you edit it. There are similar plugins available for using ESLint and Prettier from within other IDEs and text editors.
